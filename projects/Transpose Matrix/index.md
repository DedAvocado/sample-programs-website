In this article, we'll demonstrate how to find Transpose of a Matrix, its requirements, and how
to test it.

## Description

In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix A by producing another matrix, often denoted by Aáµ€. The transpose of a matrix was introduced in 1858 by the British mathematician Arthur Cayley.

The solution can be generated using nested loops and exchanging the indexes of the matrix.

## Requirements

The following is the expected output:
1 2 3      1 4 7
4 5 6  ->  2 5 8
7 8 9      3 6 9

1.  The first matrix is from the given input.
2.  The second  matrix is the desired output i.e, the transpose.

## Testing

Verify that the actual output matches the expected output (see [requirements][1])
